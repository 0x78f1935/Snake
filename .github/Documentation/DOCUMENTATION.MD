# How to use Snake?

I expect you have read the [README](https://github.com/Annihilator708/Snake#welcome-to-snake) file which includes how to [install](https://github.com/Annihilator708/Snake#installation) Snake.
\
The toolbar provided in version V0.0.1 and V0.0.2 are depricated and are no 
\
longer available in higher versions. The toolbar has been replaced with tabs. 
\
With those tabs you are able to navigate between all the tools. The first tab 
\
will be the

## Editor

The editor provide a place to type anything you want. It is possible to save and
\
load any file. You can find those options in the header menu. When you are done
\
with any tool provided from snake you are able to quickly copy the code into the
\
editor tab. Make sure when you use a button like that you have saved your work 
\
in the editor. **`Otherwise data could be lost`**.

## Scraper

The scraper provide you a way to look for hidden objects on websites. Very usefull
\
for many reasons. So why not include it. When your clicking on this tab your text
\
editor will change in a read only field. This is so build so the result and the 
\
editor will stay in their own bubble.

### Spider fetch
Extend your search results. Without this option turned on the scraper searches
\
only on the page given in the input. However when this option is turned on the
\
scraper scrapes the links which where found on the very first scrape result aka
\
your input url. **`Note: When there are many results to fetch the GUI may freeze.`**
\
**`The process will still run in the background and a warning is build in when`**
\
**`this may happen. The GUI will fix itself after its done with scraping.`**

### Target only
Sometimes you get alot of junk with your fetch. When you turn this option on you
\
are basically turning a filter on. Only results with the host site will be
\
in your results.

### Fetch
When clicking on this button a request is made to the given url. This only happens
\
once unless you hace **spider fetch** turned on. When the progress bar hit **100%**
\
the results will be displayed in the textfield.

### Copy to Editor
Copy your fetch results to your editor. Make sure any data in the editor is saved
\
before doing this. **`Otherwise data could be lost`**. After you have done this
\
you are able to use the editor as normal.

## Preferences
Change any GUI preferences.
