# What is new to Snake.

> Snake is basically a web crawler put into a PyQt5 Framework. The software is completely > written by me. Just for fun to be honest with you. Normally people write documentation for their software, so this is my attempt. Just know the software is in early development.

"Snake" has a build in text editor to make life easy. Slide with you buddy "Python3.7" like a snake through the data the internet offers and save it right away to your system. Or as a text editor suggests edit your fetch!
